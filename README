MiMMS 2.x - MiMMS isn't an MMS Message Sender.
It's an MMS (e.g. mms://) stream downloader.

MiMMS is a program designed to allow you to download streams using the MMS protocol
and save them to your computer, as opposed to watching them live. Similar functionality
is available in full media player suites such as Xine and MPlayer, but MiMMS is quick
and easy to use, and for the time being, remains a useful program.

Originally, MiMMS was forked directly from the last known version of mmsclient, which was
for years unmaintained. MiMMS started with the following goals:

  - Keep a working copy of "mmsclient" (now "MiMMS") maintained and working.
  - Fix lots of the bugs that were in mmsclient
  - Eventually extend the functionality of the program

With the current 2.x series, MiMMS shares no code with mmsclient, and actually does all of
it's MMS operations using libmms, a new library based off of the xine-improved mmsclient
code, which is designed to allow multiple implementations of MMS clients without requiring
a fragmented code base. At this point, MiMMS is freed from the details of the horrendous
MMS protocol, and can focus on usability.

Currently MiMMS has the following dependencies:

  * libmms   (required) - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmms>
  * Qt4 Core (required) - <http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/>
  * wget     (optional) - <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>
    - (necessary if you want to use http:// URLs to get e.g. ASX files)

Of course, you also need any dependencies of the above software, as well as a more-or-less
standard POSIX environment since we depend on make, install, etc. being available during build.
